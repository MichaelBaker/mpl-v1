# Amateur PLT Field Guide

## Preface (Why am I writing this and why should anyone care?)
* Understand the software we write at a deeper level. Forget syntax, sweat what matters.
* Clarify understanding of language features. What makes a feature good? What features do we want?
* Common knowledge that all languages share. Makes you knowledge portable.
* Language design and software design go hand in hand.
* I'll come back to dynamic languages after talking about types for a bit.
* Make sure to relate each feature to some kind of object oriented or dynamic feature.

## Before functions programs were nasty, brutish, and long
## The Common Function
